# 1) import Boston housing training data.

# load training data into corresponding X (features) & Y (desired outputs) matrices.

# add as first column of X the dummy variable of '1'.

# compute optimal weight vector w (may use package such as numpy).

# print the learned weight vector (w).

# 2) import Boston housing testing data.

# using w, compute the ASE of training and testing data.

# print out trainging ASE and testing ASE and which is largest.
